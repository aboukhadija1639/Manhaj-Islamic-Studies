# Phase 1: Curriculum & Manhaj Analysis

## Repository Analysis

### Current Structure

The Manhaj Islamic Studies platform currently implements a **modern educational framework** for the University of El-Oued's Bachelor program in Islamic Sciences. The repository demonstrates a **functional approach** to curriculum delivery with three-tier categorization:

**Sharia Sciences (العلوم الشرعية الأساسية)** form the core with five modules totaling 26 credits and 195 hours. These include Quranic Sciences (6 credits, 45 hours), Fiqh of Worship (6 credits, 45 hours), Islamic Creed (5 credits, 37.5 hours), Prophetic Biography (4 credits, 30 hours), and Principles of Jurisprudence (5 credits, 37.5 hours).

**Supporting Sciences (العلوم المساعدة)** provide methodological tools with three modules totaling 12 credits and 90 hours. These comprise Arabic Language (5 credits, 37.5 hours), Research Methodology (4 credits, 30 hours), and Educational Sciences (3 credits, 22.5 hours).

**Technical Sciences (العلوم التقنية واللغوية)** offer modern competencies with two modules totaling 6 credits and 45 hours, including Computer Science (3 credits, 22.5 hours) and English Language (3 credits, 22.5 hours).

### Implicit Manhaj Vision

Through careful analysis of the repository structure, course organization, and educational philosophy, several implicit Manhaj principles emerge:

**Integration Over Fragmentation**: The three-tier categorization (Sharia, Supporting, Technical) suggests an understanding that Islamic knowledge is not isolated. The presence of Arabic Language as a "supporting" science indicates recognition that language is the **key tool** for accessing primary texts. The inclusion of Research Methodology shows awareness that students need **systematic approaches** to knowledge acquisition.

**Purpose-Driven Knowledge**: Each module includes not just topics but also **objectives** (أهداف), indicating that learning is goal-oriented rather than information-accumulation. The Fiqh module focuses on worship (عبادات), suggesting that knowledge should lead to **correct practice**. The Aqeedah module emphasizes distinguishing correct from deviant belief, showing that knowledge serves **protection and guidance**.

**Hierarchical Epistemology**: The categorization itself reveals an implicit hierarchy. Sharia Sciences are labeled "أساسية" (foundational/essential), indicating their **primacy**. Supporting Sciences are "مساعدة" (auxiliary), showing they **serve** the primary sciences. Technical Sciences are practical tools for **modern engagement**.

**Text-Centered Approach**: The prominence of Quranic Sciences and the emphasis on Arabic Language reveal a **text-first epistemology**. Understanding comes from **direct engagement with revelation**, not abstract theorizing. The Seerah module contextualizes revelation, showing that **text and context** are inseparable.

**Spiritual-Intellectual Balance**: The inclusion of Aqeedah alongside Fiqh shows that **belief and practice** are unified. The presence of Educational Sciences suggests awareness that **how we teach** affects **what students become**. The Manhaj recognizes that knowledge without **Tazkiyah** (purification) can be harmful.

### Gaps in Current Implementation

While the current structure is functional, it lacks explicit articulation of the **Manhaj philosophy**. Students see modules but may not understand **why they study what they study** or **how sciences interconnect**. There is no visual representation of the **epistemological hierarchy** or the **functional relationships** between sciences.

The current UI presents modules as independent units rather than as an **integrated system**. There is no "Manhaj Overview" page that explains the **vision and purpose** of the curriculum. Students cannot easily see how Aqeedah **governs** all other sciences, or how Arabic **unlocks** Quran and Hadith.

## Curriculum Framework Potential

### From Content to Framework

The repository can evolve from a **content delivery platform** to a **curriculum framework** by making the following transformations:

**Explicit Manhaj Articulation**: Create a comprehensive "Manhaj Vision" document that explains the **philosophy of integration**, the **purpose of each science**, and the **spiritual-intellectual goals** of the program.

**Visual Epistemology**: Develop interactive diagrams showing the **hierarchical structure** of knowledge, where Aqeedah is at the center, Quran and Sunnah are the sources, Arabic is the key, and Fiqh is the application.

**Learning Pathways**: Design clear pathways showing **recommended study sequences**, **prerequisite relationships**, and **skill dependencies** (e.g., Arabic grammar before Quranic exegesis).

**Science Interconnections**: For each module, explicitly show its **functional role** in the larger system (e.g., "Usul al-Fiqh provides the methodology for deriving rulings from Quran and Sunnah").

**Purpose Before Content**: Each science should begin with its **purpose** (لماذا؟), **educational goal** (ماذا يصبح الطالب؟), and **practical outcome** (الأثر العملي) before diving into topics.

### Manhaj as Curriculum Framework

A true **Manhaj-based framework** would include:

**Foundational Principles**: Clear articulation of Islamic epistemology (knowledge comes from revelation, reason serves revelation, language is the tool, practice is the goal).

**Science Taxonomy**: Hierarchical classification showing **revealed sciences** (Quran, Hadith), **derived sciences** (Fiqh, Usul), **instrumental sciences** (Arabic, Logic), and **contextual sciences** (Seerah, History).

**Integration Model**: Visual and conceptual model showing how sciences **depend on** and **serve** each other (e.g., Fiqh depends on Usul, which depends on Arabic, which unlocks Quran).

**Student Journey**: Clear progression from **foundational knowledge** (Aqeedah, Arabic) to **methodological tools** (Usul, Methodology) to **applied sciences** (Fiqh, Tafsir).

**Spiritual Dimension**: Explicit integration of **Tazkiyah** (purification), **Adab al-Talab** (etiquette of seeking knowledge), and **Tarbiyah** (spiritual education) throughout the curriculum.

## Islamic Epistemology Principles

### Knowledge as Worship

In Islamic epistemology, **seeking knowledge is an act of worship** ('ibadah). This principle must permeate the entire platform:

Knowledge is not pursued for **career advancement** or **social status** but for **drawing closer to Allah**. Every science studied should be framed as a means of **understanding Allah's commands** and **implementing His will**. The platform should remind students that **intention** (niyyah) transforms study into worship.

### Revelation as Primary Source

Islamic knowledge begins with **revelation** (Quran and authentic Sunnah), not human speculation. This epistemological foundation means:

**Quran and Hadith** are the ultimate sources of truth. **Reason** ('aql) is valid but **serves** revelation, not replaces it. **Arabic language** is not just a tool but the **medium of revelation**. **Ijma'** (consensus) and **Qiyas** (analogy) are valid but **derived** from primary texts.

### Integration of Knowledge

Islamic tradition rejects the **fragmentation** of knowledge into isolated disciplines. Instead:

All knowledge is **unified** under the framework of Tawhid (Divine Unity). **Aqeedah** (creed) governs how we approach all other sciences. **Fiqh** (jurisprudence) is the **practical application** of Aqeedah. **Arabic** is the **key** that unlocks Quran and Sunnah. **Seerah** provides the **living context** for understanding revelation.

### Purpose-Driven Learning

Knowledge in Islam is not abstract but **purposeful**:

The goal is **correct belief** (Aqeedah sahihah). The goal is **correct worship** (Ibadah sahihah). The goal is **correct character** (Akhlaq hasanah). The goal is **correct understanding** (Fahm sahih). The goal is **beneficial action** ('Amal salih).

### Teacher-Student Relationship

Islamic education emphasizes the **spiritual chain** (isnad) and **ethical relationship** (adab):

Knowledge is transmitted through **trustworthy teachers** (ulama). Students must have **proper etiquette** (adab al-talib). Learning requires **humility** (tawadu') and **sincerity** (ikhlas). The teacher is not just an **information source** but a **spiritual guide**.

## Recommendations for Phase 2

Based on this analysis, Phase 2 should design a **Manhaj Curriculum Map** that:

**Makes the implicit explicit**: Articulate the philosophical foundations and epistemological principles clearly.

**Visualizes integration**: Create diagrams showing how sciences interconnect and depend on each other.

**Defines purposes**: For each science, clearly state its **purpose**, **goal**, **functional role**, and **practical outcome**.

**Shows progression**: Design learning pathways that guide students from foundations to applications.

**Emphasizes spirituality**: Integrate Tazkiyah, Adab, and Tarbiyah throughout the curriculum.

**Enables exploration**: Allow students to understand **why** they study what they study and **how** it serves their ultimate goal of drawing closer to Allah.

## Conclusion

The current repository demonstrates **functional competence** but lacks **explicit Manhaj articulation**. By transforming it into a **Curriculum Framework** that makes Islamic epistemology visible, integrates sciences meaningfully, and emphasizes purpose over content, we can create a platform that not only delivers information but **shapes students** into scholars who understand the **unity of knowledge**, the **primacy of revelation**, and the **purpose of learning** as worship.

This is the foundation upon which Phase 2 will build a comprehensive, visually compelling, and spiritually purposeful **Manhaj Curriculum Map**.
