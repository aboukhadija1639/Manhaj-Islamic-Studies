# Phase 2: Manhaj Curriculum Map
## Semester 1 – Year 1 – Bachelor (Licence) in Sharia Sciences

---

## Manhaj Vision Statement

**منهاج العلوم الشرعية** (Manhaj of Sharia Sciences) is not merely a collection of courses but an **integrated system of knowledge** rooted in Islamic epistemology. Our Manhaj recognizes that:

**Knowledge is worship** ('ilm 'ibadah), not information accumulation. Every science studied is a means of drawing closer to Allah through understanding His revelation, implementing His commands, and purifying the soul.

**Integration over fragmentation** (al-takamul la al-tafarruq). Islamic knowledge forms a unified whole under the framework of Tawhid. Aqeedah governs all sciences, Arabic unlocks revelation, Usul structures jurisprudence, and Seerah contextualizes texts.

**Purpose before content** (al-ghayah qabl al-maddah). We do not study for degrees but to become scholars who understand correctly, worship correctly, and live correctly. Every science has a clear purpose, educational goal, and practical outcome.

**Text-centered epistemology** (al-nass asas al-ma'rifah). Our knowledge begins with revelation (Quran and Sunnah), accessed through Arabic, understood through context (Seerah), structured through methodology (Usul), and applied through jurisprudence (Fiqh).

**Spiritual-intellectual balance** (al-tawazun bayn al-'ilm wa al-'amal). Knowledge without purification (Tazkiyah) breeds arrogance. Practice without knowledge breeds innovation. Our Manhaj unifies belief, knowledge, and action.
